# franchise-map
A web-based application that allows users to visualize and manage the geographic coverage areas of multiple franchise stores. Built with Node.js + Express for backend and Leaflet.js for interactive mapping, the system enables users to input store addresses, assign names and colors, define service radii, and view their impact zones on the map.
